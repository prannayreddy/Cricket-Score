# CricketScore
Keep score of your own game of India's favorite Cricket!

Hi coders, in this github post i've implemented my own logic to keep track of the overs and wickets in the game. Any critical feedback is highly appreciated.
I've just attached the activity_main.xml and MainActivity.java files.
You can copy and paste the files to the respective files when you create a new project on android studio and run it :)
Thank you :)

UPDATE- I've also added the strings.xml for reference :)
